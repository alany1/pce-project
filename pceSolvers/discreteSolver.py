Suggestion:
As the inital solve is often the bottleneck, maybe we can improve the performance by first restricting to the set
of rationalizable strategies.

Can also increase threads further and investigate presolve option.

Also can try to use a different solver (e.g. PYGLPK) and see if that helps.
